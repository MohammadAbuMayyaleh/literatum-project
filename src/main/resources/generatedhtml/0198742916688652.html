            Abstract
        </h3>
        <p>
        <p>The purpose of this study was to identify statewide trends in school approaches to student discipline and
            examine the associations between punitive discipline practices and student, school, and local education
            agency (LEA) characteristics. In addition, we compared punitive disciplinary practices for schools and LEAs
            that do and do not allow corporal punishment. Publicly available data from the 2010&ndash;2011 Florida
            Department of Education and Common Core of Data were used to assess associations between (a) punitive
            discipline practices (i.e., suspensions, expulsions, restraints, corporal punishment, and changes of
            placement) and student characteristics (i.e., grade level, gender, and race), (b) punitive discipline
            practices (without corporal punishment) and school and LEA characteristics, and (c) school use of corporal
            punishment and school and LEA characteristics. Results of descriptive comparisons, tests of association, and
            multilevel regression analyses indicated that schools with higher ratios of (a) students receiving free and
            reduced lunch and (b) Black or African American students more frequently employed punitive discipline
            practices, and that punitive discipline practices were disproportionately used with males and Black or
            African American students. We provide additional results and implications for research, policy, and
            practice.</p>

    <p>More than 20 years have passed since the initiation of &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; policies that followed
        passage of <a href="#">The Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994</a> (PL No. 103-882, Sec. 14601). Researchers and
        advocates have long voiced concerns that the Act has resulted in frequent use of negative, reactive, and harsh
        consequences in schools, including punitive and exclusionary discipline practices (e.g., <a href="#">Skiba et
            al., 2011</a>; <a href="#">Smith &amp; Harper, 2015</a>). Specifically, suspension, expulsion, changes of
        placement, and restraint are commonly used to address a variety of youth behaviors. Furthermore, corporal
        punishment is still used in 19 states to address student misbehavior (<a href="#">The Center for Effective
            Discipline, 2013</a>). Only recently has the broadening of &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; policies received
        national repudiation (see <a href="#">U.S. Department of Education [USDOE], 2014b</a>), and many state education
        agencies (SEAs) and local education agencies (LEAs) and schools have yet to alter their reliance on these
        approaches.</p>
    <p>Evidence exists suggesting that the use of punitive and exclusionary discipline practices (i.e., suspensions,
        expulsions, restraints, corporal punishment, changes of placement) disproportionately affects certain youth, and
        national trends have indicated the disproportionate use of punitive discipline practices across gender, race,
        and disability (<a href="#">Bowman-Perrott et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#">Skiba et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#">USDOE,
            2014a</a>). For example, Black or African American (see <a href="#">Note 1</a>) and Latino students are more
        likely to be suspended or expelled than Caucasian students (<a href="#">Skiba et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#">USDOE,
            2016</a>; <a href="#">Wallace, Goodkind, Wallace, &amp; Bachman, 2008</a>). Although Black or African
        American students comprise 16% of the total student population, these students comprise 33% of out-of-school
        suspensions, 42% of multiple out-of-school suspensions, and 34% of expulsions (<a href="#">USDOE, 2014a</a>).
    </p>
    <p>The disproportionate use of punitive discipline practices for students with disabilities and for male students is
        also concerning. Students with disabilities are about 2 times more likely than their nondisabled peers to be
        suspended one or more times and account for 75% of restraints (<a href="#">USDOE, 2014a</a>). Although the U.S.
        school populations of boys and girls are roughly equivalent, boys account for almost 75% of students receiving
        multiple out-of-school suspensions and expulsion (<a href="#">USDOE, 2014a</a>).</p>
    <p>Research analyzing state- and local-level data by race has consistently reported that minorities, and
        specifically Black or African American students, are disproportionally suspended (<a href="#">Balfanz, Byrnes,
            &amp; Fox, 2012</a>; <a href="#">Costenbader &amp; Markson, 1998</a>; <a href="#">Fabelo et al., 2011</a>;
        <a href="#">Krezmien, Leone, &amp; Achilles, 2006</a>; <a href="#">Morris &amp; Perry, 2016</a>; <a href="#">Nichols,
            2004</a>; <a href="#">Rausch &amp; Skiba, 2005</a>; <a href="#">Skiba et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#">Skiba,
            Michael, Nardo, &amp; Peterson, 2002</a>; <a href="#">Sullivan, Klingbeil, &amp; Van Norman, 2013</a>; <a
                href="#">Sullivan, Van Norman, &amp; Klingbeil, 2014</a>; <a href="#">Theriot, Craun, &amp; Dupper,
            2010</a>) and expelled (<a href="#">Nichols, 2004</a>; <a href="#">Skiba et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#">Skiba
            et al., 2002</a>). At the school level, the percentage of Black or African American students enrolled is a
        predictor of suspension and expulsion (<a href="#">Skiba et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, researchers have reported
        links between suspension and gender (<a href="#">Costenbader &amp; Markson, 1998</a>; <a href="#">Morris &amp;
            Perry, 2016</a>; <a href="#">Skiba et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#">Skiba et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#">Sullivan
            et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#">Sullivan et al., 2014</a>) and between suspension and student disability (<a
                href="#">Balfanz et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#">Krezmien et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#">Morris &amp;
            Perry, 2016</a>; <a href="#">Sullivan et al., 2013</a>). State and local research has also substantiated
        links between suspension and poverty (<a href="#">Balfanz et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#">Christle, Nelson, &amp;
            Jolivette, 2004</a>; <a href="#">Morris &amp; Perry, 2016</a>; <a href="#">Nichols, 2004</a>; <a href="#">Skiba
            et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#">Sullivan et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#">Sullivan et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#">Theriot
            et al., 2010</a>).</p>
    <p>The scope of research on punitive discipline practices is limited, however, by several factors including the
        specific disciplinary practices of focus and the lack of inclusion of student variables in analyses. For
        example, many studies have focused only on suspension (<a href="#">Arcia, 2006</a>, <a href="#">2007</a>; <a
                href="#">Balfanz et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#">Christle et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#">Costenbader &amp;
            Markson, 1998</a>; <a href="#">Krezmien et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#">Mendez &amp; Knoff, 2003</a>; <a
                href="#">Morris &amp; Perry, 2016</a>; <a href="#">Sullivan et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#">Sullivan et
            al., 2014</a>) or only suspension and expulsion (<a href="#">Rausch &amp; Skiba, 2005</a>; <a href="#">Skiba
            et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#">Skiba et al., 2002</a>), with few including information on change of placement
        (<a href="#">Fabelo et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#">Mendez, Knoff, &amp; Ferron, 2002</a>; <a href="#">Nichols,
            2004</a>). None of the studies we identified using state- or local-level data included a focus on instances
        of restraint or the use of corporal punishment. A majority of the state and local research also omits key
        student variables that are associated with increases in punitive discipline practices (i.e., race, gender,
        disability, poverty, grade level) in national data.</p>
    <p>Studies of punitive discipline practices are also limited by the scope of the data collected. For example,
        statewide data have been reviewed for only four states (i.e., Kentucky, Maryland, Florida, Texas; see <a
                href="#">Balfanz et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#">Christle et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#">Fabelo et al.,
            2011</a>; <a href="#">Krezmien et al., 2006</a>), with other studies indicating that the data were from
        unidentified Midwest states (<a href="#">Rausch &amp; Skiba, 2005</a>; <a href="#">Skiba et al., 2014</a>).
        Additional limitations to extant research hinder attempts to establish a clear picture of the use of punitive
        discipline practices. For example, few studies have disaggregated data by grade or school level (<a href="#">Arcia
            2006</a>, <a href="#">2007</a>; <a href="#">Mendez &amp; Knoff, 2003</a>; <a href="#">Mendez et al.,
            2002</a>; <a href="#">Nichols, 2004</a>; <a href="#">Rausch &amp; Skiba, 2005</a>). Although information is
        limited, there is evidence that students in middle school are suspended at higher rates than those in elementary
        or high school (<a href="#">Arcia, 2006</a>, <a href="#">2007</a>; <a href="#">Mendez et al., 2002</a>).
        Finally, almost no recent data exist regarding punitive discipline practices, with only four studies using data
        collected since 2010 (<a href="#">Losen &amp; Martinez, 2013</a>; <a href="#">Morris &amp; Perry, 2016</a>; <a
                href="#">Sullivan et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#">Sullivan et al., 2014</a>).</p>
    <section>
        <h3>Punitive Discipline Practices in Florida</h3>
        <p>Florida is one state for which there is a critical need for a comprehensive analysis of punitive discipline
            practices in schools. As the state with the fourth largest student population, summary statistics from the
            Civil Rights Data Collection and National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) indicate that Florida
            suspends the highest percentage of students in the country at both the elementary and secondary levels (<a
                    href="#">Losen, Hodson, Keith, Morrison, &amp; Belway, 2015</a>; <a href="#">Snyder &amp; Dillow,
                2015</a>). Beyond this broad and rather disturbing statistic, however, there is little understanding of
            discipline in Florida schools.</p>
        <p>Conclusions from three existing studies examining disciplinary practices in Florida are hampered by many of
            the aforementioned issues. For example, there are serious limitations to the breadth of the student
            population studied, with two studies focusing only on a single LEA (<a href="#">Mendez &amp; Knoff, 2003</a>;
            <a href="#">Mendez et al., 2002</a>), whereas a third addressed a statewide cohort of ninth-grade students (<a
                    href="#">Balfanz et al., 2012</a>). Although the studies address student characteristics, their
            scope provides an insufficient representation of associations between punitive discipline practices and
            youth characteristics or school-level variables. Concerns with the studies also exist in terms of the
            punitive discipline practices analyzed, with all three studies addressing suspension and excluding
            expulsions, restraints, corporal punishment, and changes of placement. There is particular concern with the
            lack of research on the use of corporal punishment. Of the five states with the largest student populations,
            Florida is one of only two that allows corporal punishment in schools. We are aware of no research that has
            evaluated potential associations between the use of corporal punishment and SEA and LEA characteristics in
            Florida. Given the significant gaps in research concerning punitive discipline practices for the state of
            Florida, statewide research that includes important student, school, and LEA variables within analyses is
            urgently needed.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive statewide picture of the use of punitive discipline
            practices. We evaluated five common reactive approaches to student misbehavior: suspension, expulsion,
            change of placement, restraint, and corporal punishment. <i>Suspension</i> refers to the short-term
            exclusion of a student from the regular education setting because of a violation of school behavior policies
            (National Clearinghouse on Supportive School Discipline <a href="#">[NCSSD], 2015b</a>). <i>Expulsion</i>
            refers to a more severe consequence of a behavioral infraction that results in the permanent exclusion of a
            student from the regular educational setting (<a href="#">NCSSD, 2015a</a>). A disciplinary <i>change of
                placement</i> involves removing a student from the educational environment for a period exceeding 10
            days or a series of removals that constitute a pattern (<a href="#">Individuals with Disabilities Education
                Act [IDEA], 2006</a>). <i>Restraint</i> can be either mechanical or physical, and these forms are
            combined within the current research. Mechanical restraints are defined as a device used to restrict student
            movement, whereas physical restraint relies on physically restricting a student&rsquo;s movement (<a
                    href="#">USDOE, 2014a</a>). <i>Corporal punishment</i> refers to a response to student misbehavior
            wherein an adult typically uses a wooden board to strike a child&rsquo;s buttocks and inflict pain (<a
                    href="#">American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, 1988</a>; <a href="#">Farmer &amp;
                Neier, 2009</a>).</p>
        <p>The following research questions guided our investigation:</p>
        <p>
            <b>Research Question 1:</b> Do associations exist between the frequency and type of punitive discipline
            practice used (i.e., suspensions, expulsions, restraints, corporal punishment, changes of placement) and
            student characteristics (i.e., grade level, gender, and race)?</p>
        <p>
            <b>Research Question 2:</b> Do associations exist between the use of punitive discipline practices (i.e.,
            suspensions, expulsions, restraints, changes of placement) and (a) school-level variables (i.e., percentage
            of students receiving special education, school locale, school level, percentage of students who receive
            free or reduced price lunch [FRL], percentage of Black or African American students) and (b) LEA-level
            allowance of corporal punishment, after controlling for other school and LEA variables?</p>
        <p>
            <b>Research Question 3:</b> Do associations exist between school-level variables (i.e., school-level grade
            ranges: prekindergarten [PK] to 5, 6&ndash;8, 9&ndash;12; percentage of students receiving special
            education; school locale; percentage of students receiving FRL; percentage of Black or African American) and
            the frequency of corporal punishment in schools in LEAs allowing corporal punishment?</p>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <section>
            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>We used secondary survey data from the Florida Department of Education (DOE) 2010-2011 and Common Core of
                Data (CCD) <i>Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey 2010-11</i> (v.2a; <a href="#">CCD,
                    2011</a>) as the basis for analyses in this study. The CCD nonfiscal data are submitted annually to
                NCES by SEAs in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the four U.S. Island Areas, the
                Department of Defense Education Activity, and the Bureau of Indian Education. Florida collects school
                and LEA data annually via a survey sent to each LEA. A summary of Florida data are publicly available
                and include (a) school (within each LEA) enrollment numbers by grade, including race and sex; (b) number
                of elementary, middle, and high schools by LEA; (c) Title 1 schools by LEA; (d) FRL (ages 5&ndash;17) by
                LEA and school; (e) in-school suspensions, out-of-school suspensions, and expulsions by school and LEA;
                (f) corporal punishments and suspensions by race and grade; (g) schools by LEA and the total number of
                uses of corporal punishment; and (h) school locale. School data were collected via the Office of
                Education Information and Accountability Services Automated Student and Staff Databases.</p>
            <p>We created three separate data sets to examine the research questions. One data set was obtained by
                aggregating the number of occurrences for punitive interventions in Florida by grade level, gender, and
                race. Analysis of this data set allowed us to understand general trends in the use of punitive
                discipline practices. A second data set included data for schools nested within LEAs and documented the
                number of occurrences for punitive discipline practices in each school, as well as school and LEA
                characteristics. Analysis of this set allowed us to investigate associations between school
                characteristics and differences in the use of punitive discipline practices for schools after
                controlling for LEA differences. A final data set was a subset of the second data set and contained data
                only from LEAs allowing corporal punishment. We used this data set to examine associations between the
                frequency of corporal punishment and school characteristics.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
            <section>
                <h3>Missing data</h3>
                <p>The first data set that documented punitive discipline practices at the state level did not include
                    missing data. The second and third data sets included schools with missing data for various school
                    characteristics. The second data set, for example, involved an initial sample size of 3,300 schools,
                    from which four schools were omitted due to the lack of student information (i.e., only
                    teacher/adult information was reported). Information was also not available for some school
                    predictor variables, and a small number of LEAs reported data for only one school. We used a
                    listwise deletion procedure to address these issues before proceeding with analyses, and omitted 543
                    schools (16.5%) that did not report data for students classified as special education and an
                    additional 37 (1.1%) schools that did not report at least one of the independent variables in the
                    model. Our final analytic sample included 2725 (82.6%) schools reporting punitive discipline
                    practices.</p>
                <p>The initial LEA sample size was 71 LEAs. After performing listwise deletions, we excluded LEAs in
                    which only one school remained in the sample. A final sample of 61 LEAs (85.9%) was included at
                    Level 2.</p>
                <p>Our third data set, used for analyses of corporal punishment, was a subset of the initial sample of
                    LEAs in which corporal punishment was allowed (<i>n</i> = 43 LEAs). Schools within LEAs that did not
                    allow corporal punishment were deleted, leaving 965 total schools. For reasons related to the
                    analyses performed, it was necessary to use listwise deletion for schools with at least one missing
                    data point among the predictors, as well as to exclude LEAs with only one school. The final analytic
                    sample for analyses of corporal punishment use included 899 schools (93.2%) from 40 LEAs (93.0%).
                </p>
                <p>The descriptive statistics provided in <a href="#">Table 1</a> reveal comparable means and standard
                    deviations for all variables in the initial sample and in the analytic sample. In addition, we have
                    estimated standardized mean differences among initial and analytic samples (i.e., Cohen&rsquo;s
                    <i>d</i>; <a href="#">Cohen, 1988</a>) for every categorical and continuous variable that are
                    involved in the two-part analysis. According to What Works Clearinghouse standards (<a href="#">USDOE,
                        Institute of Education Sciences, What Works Clearinghouse, 2013</a>), an effect size that is
                    smaller than .05 in absolute value indicates that the compared groups are equivalent in terms of the
                    comparison characteristic. However, effect sizes greater than .25 do not satisfy the baseline
                    equivalence condition. Only the Corporal Punishment Allowance variable did not meet the .05 criteria
                    (Cohen&rsquo;s <i>d</i> = &minus;0.10), indicating that the listwise deletion mechanism and Corporal
                    Punishment Allowance variable have 0.26% variance in common, which is less than 1% and quite low.
                    The effect size for all covariates was still below the .25 standard for the equivalence. Although we
                    do not justify the use of listwise deletion by comparing the consistency of means and standard
                    deviations for data sets, these similarities suggest that additional bias was not introduced by

                <h3>Analysis for Research Question 1</h3>
                <p>Research Question 1 has three facets and each aims to investigate the relation between punitive
                    discipline practice and (a) grade level, (b) race, and (c) gender. We describe the overall
                    statistical procedures that allow us to answer the research question and also provide details for
                    each particular facet.</p>
                <p>First, we calculated statewide frequency of enforcement for each punitive discipline practice by
                    student grade, race, and gender. To examine associations, we used <i>loglinear models</i> for
                    contingency tables (i.e., array of counts of two or more dimensions; <a href="#">Birch, 1963</a>).
                    <a href="#">Nelder and Wedderburn (1972)</a> clarified that Poisson regression can be used to fit
                    loglinear models. We selected Poisson regression because the outcome (i.e., frequency of the
                    punitive discipline practice) is count data, which may have only nonnegative integer values. Poisson
                    distribution is the simplest distribution matching the nature of the count data; therefore, Poisson
                    regression was used to investigate dependence (<a href="#">Agresti, 2007</a>). We used the following
                    models:</p>
                <p>(1)log(μ)=α+β1X1+β2X2,</p>
                <p>(2)log(μ)=α+β1X1+β2X2+γ12+X1X2,</p>
                <p>where &micro; is the count of punitive intervention enforcement, α is the intercept, <i>X</i>1 and
                    <i>X</i>2 are independent variables, β1 and β2 are main effects, and γ12 is the interaction effect.
                    Because the two models are nested, they can be compared using the residual deviance (i.e., a
                    statistic that measures the severity of the lack of fit) of the model without the interaction term
                    for the chi-square distribution. Insofar as the omitted interaction term is equal to the difference
                    between the second and first models, the residual deviance statistic from the first model reflects
                    the severity of model misspecification due to the ignored interaction term. In other words, a
                    statistically significant residual deviance statistic indicates the interaction term is significant;
                    hence, we are able to conclude a dependence between <i>X</i>1 and <i>X</i>2.</p>
                <p>Two limitations to this method should be noted. First, results obtained via the chi-square tests of
                    independence do not imply directionality for the found associations (<a href="#">Agresti, 2007</a>;
                    <a href="#">Fox &amp; Weisberg, 2011</a>). In addition to the directional limitation, differing
                    group sizes used when directly comparing totals can result in false assumptions. To account for
                    group size differences, we used a weighting approach where the total occurrence of a disciplinary
                    practice received by a student group was multiplied by the overall population size and divided by
                    the number of groups and the population size. The population sizes reflected the actual number of
                    students in Florida in 2010-2011. Upon weighting the totals, we rounded to the closest integer.
                    Thus, we projected the frequencies for each punitive discipline practice per group to the condition
                    in which there were hypothetically equivalent numbers of students per group. The following formula
                    was developed to obtain the weighted frequencies:</p>
                <p>y&lowast;=yi(1numberofgroups)&times;(totalpopulationsizepopulationsizeinaparticulargroup),</p>
                <p>where <i>yi</i> is the actual frequency for a punitive discipline practice in a population and yi&lowast;
                    is the weighted frequency for the same punitive discipline practice for the hypothetical student
                    population.</p>
                <section>
                    <h3>Grade level</h3>
                    <p>We analyzed associations by grade level and weighted total of punitive discipline practices,
                        where the first level in the model included PK through fifth grade, the second level included
                        sixth grade through eighth grade, and the third level included ninth grade through 12th grade.
                        We fit a Poisson regression model where the disciplinary practice and grade level predicted the
                        weighted total number of disciplinary practices in each cell, assuming the cell counts are
                        independent Poisson random variables. The residual deviance was the difference between deviance
                        of this model of independence and deviance of a saturated model in which the association term
                        (i.e., the interaction between total number of disciplinary actions and grade level) was added.
                        If the residual deviance for the first model was statistically different than zero, an
                        interaction term was used to explain the relation properly and, thus, an association existed
                        between grade levels and different types of the punitive discipline practices.</p>

                    <h3>Race</h3>
                    <p>Using a similar procedure, we evaluated the relation between race and weighted total number of
                        different punitive discipline practices where race is categorized as Caucasian, Black or African
                        American, Hispanic, and Other. Again, we fit a linear Poisson regression model where the
                        disciplinary practice and gender predicted the weighted total number of disciplinary practices
                        in each cell, assuming the cell counts are independent Poisson random variables. Again, the
                        residual deviance statistic is evaluated to see whether an association existed between race and
                        different types of punitive discipline practices.</p>

                    <h3>Gender</h3>
                    <p>Using a similar procedure, we evaluated the relation between gender and weighted total number of
                        different punitive practices where gender is categorized as male and female. We fit a linear
                        Poisson regression model where the disciplinary practice and gender predicted the weighted total
                        number of disciplinary practices in each cell assuming the cell counts are independent Poisson
                        random variables. Again, the residual deviance statistic is evaluated to see whether an
                        association existed between gender and different types of punitive discipline practices.</p>

                <h3>Analysis for Research Question 2</h3>
                <p>We addressed Research Question 2 by investigating the association between school-level
                    characteristics, percentage of students who receive FRL, percentage of Black or African American
                    students, LEA-level characteristics (i.e., whether or not an LEA allows corporal punishment), and
                    number of punitive discipline practices for a given school after controlling for other school and
                    LEA variables. In this section, we describe and justify the statistical analysis procedure for each
                    outcome of interest.</p>
                <section>
                    <h3>Suspension</h3>
                    <p>We used a hierarchical random intercepts Poisson model to explain the association between the
                        total count of suspensions and predictors. We used a Poisson model because the outcome variable
                        was count data. It was not possible to model a more complex association due to the
                        aforementioned limitations inherent to the data set. In addition to the modeling complications,
                        the number of students differed by school. Rather than using only the suspension counts, we
                        modified the models to account for the number of unique suspensions per student in each school.
                        The term <i>YijSUSPENSION</i> was the total count of suspensions enforced in school <i>i</i> in
                        LEA <i>j</i>. To offset the effect of the number of students nested within a school, it was
                        necessary to divide <i>YijSUSPENSION</i> by <i>nij</i>, or the total number of students in
                        school <i>i</i> in LEA <i>j.</i> Inherently, the outcome of interest was the count of
                        suspensions per student in each school. This offsetting approach was appropriate, given the
                        nature of the data set. Each student was counted only once for each type of punitive discipline
                        practice, although a student could receive more than one type of punitive discipline practice,
                        such that <i>nij</i> was not a perfect offset variable. Due to the lack of a better predictor,
                        we chose to use <i>nij</i>. Assuming this problem did not occur extensively, we considered this
                        to be a good approximation of the number of suspensions enforced per student at a school,
                        offsetting <i>nij</i>. The unit-specific school-level (Level 1) model used was as follows:</p>

                    <p>where <i>ESE</i> (i.e., exceptional student education or students classified as special
                        education) refers to the percentage of students receiving special education services in a
                        school. City, suburban, and town were dummy coded school locale variables where rural area was
                        the reference category. Elementary, middle/junior high, and senior high were dummy coded
                        school-level variables where combined schools was the reference category. FRL was the percentage
                        of students who received free and reduced price lunch in a school. Black or African American was
                        the percentage of Black or African American students in a school.</p>
                    <p>The LEA-level (Level 2) model is as follows:</p>

                    <p>where the <i>CORPORAL PUNISHMENT</i> variable was a binary indicator identifying whether or not
                        an LEA allowed corporal punishment, γ00 was an overall intercept, γ01 was the main effect of
                        allowing corporal punishment in the LEA, <i>u</i>0<i>j</i> was a variance component due to
                        difference in LEAs, and γ10 through γ90 were corresponding main effects of predictors listed in

                    <h3>Expulsion</h3>
                    <p>Although our intention was to use the same model for expulsion, change of placement, and
                        restraint variables, the number of schools that did not enforce those punitive discipline
                        practices necessitated alternative approaches. Specifically, in 2010-2011, 86.6% of the 2,725
                        schools did not enforce expulsion, 70.2% of the 2,725 schools did not enforce change of
                        placement, and 84.3% of the 2,725 schools did not enforce restraint. In addition, 86.2% of 899
                        schools in LEAs allowing corporal punishment did not enforce this disciplinary practice. To deal
                        with extreme zero inflation problems, we employed a two-part multilevel model. <a href="#">Duan,
                            Manning, Morris, and Newhouse (1983)</a> concluded that, without assuming an underlying
                        normal distribution, this type of relation could be modeled in two stages. In the first stage,
                        we predicted the logit of using a particular punitive intervention at least once in a school. In
                        the second stage, we predicted the log of the number of instances per student of particular
                        punitive practices among the schools that enforced the practice at least once. Using <i>BijEXPULSION</i>
                        and <i>CijEXPULSION</i> as outcomes, two multilevel models were established where the first
                        model was a multilevel logistic random intercepts model and the second model was a multilevel
                        log normal random intercepts model that was conditioned on positive outcome value, respectively.
                        The likelihood was maximized once for both binary and continuous models under a single run to
                        guarantee that both the models were fit to the same population. The first part of the two-part
                        model was as follows:</p>
                    <p>
                        logit[p(BijEXPULSION=1)]=γ00+γ01CORPORALPUNISHMENT+u0j+γ10ESE+γ20CITY+γ30SUBURBAN+γ40TOWN+γ50ELEMENTARY+γ60MIDDLEJUNIOR+γ70SENIORHIGH+γ80FREEorREDUCEDLUNCH+γ90BLACKorAFRICANAMERICAN,</p>
                    <p>where <i>YijEXPULSION</i> was the count of expulsions enforced in school <i>i</i> in LEA <i>j</i>
                        in Florida in 2010-2011. The binary outcome <i>BijEXPULSION</i> is 0 if <i>YijEXPULSION</i> is
                        0, or 1 if expulsion was used.</p>
                    <p>The second part of the two-part multilevel model was as follows:</p>
                    <p>

                    <p>The continuous outcome <i>CijEXPULSION</i> was missing if <i>YijEXPULSION</i> was 0. Of those
                        schools that used expulsion at least once, <i>CijEXPULSION</i> was the log transformation of the
                        number of expulsions in school <i>i</i> in LEA <i>j</i>.</p>

                <h3>Analysis for Research Question 3</h3>
                <p>To answer Research Question 3, we slightly modified the model as necessitated by the analysis
                    focusing only on LEAs that allowed corporal punishment. The models were established using the third
                    data set that included 899 schools in 40 LEAs that did not have missing data for any of the
                    predictors. We excluded school locale variables because none of the city schools used corporal
                    punishment. The corporal punishment indicator was excluded from Level 2 because analyses included
                    only schools in LEAs allowing corporal punishment. We focused specifically on the relation between
                    the number of instances of corporal punishment in a school that was located in an LEA that allowed
                    corporal punishment and predictors.</p>
                <p>The combined model for the first part of the two-part model that expressed whether corporal
                    punishment was enforced at least once during the school year for a particular school was</p>

                <p>The hierarchical Poisson and logistic regression models do not have an additional error term at Level
                    1 because the link functions have their own expected value and variance (<a href="#">Raudenbush
                        &amp; Bryk, 2002</a>). Only Level 2 intercept models have a residual term. Lognormal models have
                    an error term at Level 1 because it is assumed that, after log transformation, outcomes have a log
                    normal distribution. This assumes variation in LEA-specific intercepts across LEAs. It was also
                    assumed that the effects of independent variables were constant across LEAs. We fit each of the
                    multilevel models using Mplus version 7 (<a href="#">Muth&eacute;n &amp; Muth&eacute;n, 2012</a>)
                    and used maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard error using a numerical integration
                    algorithm.</p>
                <p>Interpretations of the regression coefficients are in terms of event rate ratios or odds ratios
                    (depending on the outcome type) for every model analyzed for Research Question 3. We performed odds
                    ratio interpretation of every significant multilevel logistic regression coefficient. Odds ratio is
                    defined as the ratio of success odds in two groups that are one point apart in a particular
                    independent variable included in the multilevel logistic regression model. Event rate ratios have a
                    very similar interpretation but are designed for use in Poisson regression. Both odds ratio and
                    event ratio can only be positive. Odds and event rate ratios that are smaller than 1 are associated
                    with a decrease in the likelihood of success (number of occurrence) in the outcome variable. Odds
                    and event ratios that are greater than 1 are associated with an increase in the likelihood of
                    success (number of occurrences) in the outcome variable. A significant threshold is also interpreted
                    as the mean where every independent variable is zero. A threshold is the intercept for the logistic
                    regression and is interpreted accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>We first report specific state student population characteristics, LEA characteristics, and school
            characteristics based on data from the Florida DOE. Among the 2,644,218 registered students, 48.59%
            (<i>n</i> = 1,284,750) of the students were female and 51.41% (<i>n</i> = 1,359,468) were male. Students
            were primarily Caucasian (43.05%, <i>n</i> = 1,138,439), Hispanic (28.02%, <i>n</i> = 741,001), and Black or
            African American (22.96%, <i>n</i> = 607,242). Also, 2.46% (<i>n</i> = 64,981) were Asian, 0.11% (<i>n</i> =
            2,980) were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 0.39% (<i>n</i> = 10,356) were American Indian or Alaska
            Native, and 3.00% (<i>n</i> = 79,219) were two or more races. In addition, 47.45% (<i>n</i> = 1,254,687) of
            the students were registered in PK through fifth grade, 22.86% (<i>n</i> = 604,489) in sixth through eighth
            grade, and 29.69% (<i>n</i> = 785,042) in ninth through 12th grade. LEA and school characteristics, as well
            as overall frequency of punitive discipline practices are reported in <a href="#">Table 1</a>. In terms of
            punitive discipline practices, the most frequent practice was suspension with 548,790 incidences, followed
            by restraint with 11,048 incidences.</p>
        <section>
            <h3>Research Question 1</h3>
            <p>To investigate Research Question 1, we used the initial school sample as opposed to a reduced sample with
                deletions (see <a href="#">Table 1</a>). As previously noted, the analysis of association between the
                frequency of punitive discipline practices and student characteristics relied on weighted frequencies.
                The difference between the observed and expected weighted frequency for each punitive discipline
                practice, which identifies exactly which punitive discipline practices are more and less commonly
                applied to students with various characteristics, is reported in <a href="#">Table 2</a>.</p>Table 2.<p>

            <section>
                <h3>Grade level</h3>
                <p>Results indicated a significant association between disciplinary practices and grade level (χ2 =
                    103,600, <i>df</i> = 14, <i>p</i> &le; .001). Among punitive discipline practices, suspension was
                    used more frequently than other punitive discipline practices after controlling for group size
                    differences. The total number of punitive discipline practices after controlling for group size
                    difference was greatest for the sixth grade through eighth grade, followed by ninth grade through
                    12th grade, and least for PK through fifth grade. Corporal punishment was used much more frequently
                    in the PK through fifth grade level compared with its expected frequency. Expulsion was used more
                    frequently in ninth grade through 12th grade than expected. Restraint was used more frequently in
                    the PK through fifth grade, and less frequently in the sixth grade through eighth grade when
                    compared with the expected frequency of each grade range.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Race</h3>
                <p>There was also a significant association between the type of disciplinary practice and race (χ2 =
                    2,068, <i>df</i> = 19, <i>p</i> &le; .001). As reported in <a href="#">Table 2</a>, the total
                    weighted number of disciplinary practices in which Black or African American students were involved
                    was greater than for all other races. Similar weighted numbers of punitive discipline practices were
                    used for Caucasian students and Hispanic and Latino students. Students in the combined &ldquo;Other&rdquo;
                    race category were less frequently the recipients of punitive discipline practices. Caucasian
                    students received more corporal punishment compared with the expected weighted frequency, whereas
                    Hispanic and Latino students received less corporal punishment. Hispanic and Latino students were
                    also restrained less frequently, and students of &ldquo;Other&rdquo; races were restrained more
                    frequently than expected.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Gender</h3>
                <p>A significant association also existed between the type of disciplinary action and gender, such that
                    males received corporal punishment and expulsion more frequently (χ2 = 732.2, <i>df</i> = 9, and <i>p</i>
                    &le; .001). Considering that the number of females and males were similar, use of the weighting
                    procedure did not provide dramatically different results than the raw data.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Research Question 2</h3>
            <p>Research Question 2 focused on the relation between school-level characteristics, percentage of students
                receiving FRL, percentage of Black or African American students, whether or not an LEA allowed corporal
                punishment, and the number of punitive discipline practices documented for a school after controlling
                for other school and LEA variables.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>Suspension</h3>
                <p>Compared with combined schools, elementary school students received significantly fewer suspensions
                    within the same LEA, with an event ratio rate of 0.0382 (<i>p</i> &lt; .001; see <a href="#">Table
                        3</a>). Both middle/junior high students and senior high school students received significantly
                    more suspensions within the same LEA, with event ratios of 2.406 (<i>p</i> &lt; .001) and 2.581 (<i>p</i>
                    &lt; .001), respectively. Moreover, a 1% increase in students who received FRL and percentage of
                    Black or African American students was associated with an increase in the number of suspensions per
                    student, with event ratio rates of 1.014 (<i>p</i> &lt; .001) and 1.004 (<i>p</i> = .018),
                    respectively. In addition, schools located in LEAs allowing corporal punishment used more
                    suspensions compared with schools located in LEAs that did not allow corporal punishment, with an
                    event ratio rate of 1.346 (<i>p</i> = .002).</p>Table 3.<p>Hierarchical Random Intercept Poisson

                <h3>Restraint</h3>
                <p>As noted in <a href="#">Table 4</a>, the use of restraint was very unlikely due to the threshold of
                    4.340 (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). Within the same LEA, a 1% increase in students classified as special
                    education or who received FRL was associated with increased probability for the use of restraint,
                    with odds ratios of 1.014 (<i>p</i> = .037) and 1.013 (<i>p</i> = .020), respectively.</p>Table 4.

                    associated with an increase in the number of restraints per student at a school, with event ratio
                    rates of 1.011 (<i>p</i> = .010) and 1.007 (<i>p</i> = .023), respectively.</p>

                <h3>Expulsion</h3>
                <p>As indicated in <a href="#">Table 4</a>, the use of expulsion was very unlikely due to the threshold
                    of 3.994 (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). Compared with rural schools, suburban schools within the same LEA
                    were more likely to use expulsion, with an odds ratio of 1.866 (<i>p</i> = .006). Elementary schools
                    were less likely, and middle/junior high and senior high schools were more likely to use expulsion,
                    with odds ratios of 0.075 (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), 3.591 (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), and 8.155 (<i>p</i> &lt;
                    .001), respectively. Holding every other variable constant, a 1% difference in the percentage of
                    students receiving FRL was associated with an increase in probability of expulsion, with an odds
                    ratio of 1.019 (<i>p</i> = .001). Finally, schools within an LEA that allowed corporal punishment
                    were more likely to use expulsion, with an odds ratio of 3.086 (<i>p</i> = .021). Among schools
                    within the same LEA that used expulsion, a 1% increase in percentage of students classified as
                    special education or who received FRL was associated with an increase in number of expulsions per
                    student, with event ratio rates of 1.027 (<i>p</i> = .003) and 1.023 (<i>p</i> &lt; .001),
                    respectively.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Change of placement</h3>
                <p>Change of placement was unlikely, as reflected in the threshold of 2.881 (<i>p</i> &lt; .001; see <a
                        href="#">Table 4</a>). Within the same LEA, a 1% increase in students classified as special
                    education or who were Black or African American was associated with a decreased probability of
                    change of placement, with odds ratios of 0.985 (<i>p</i> = .038) and 0.991 (<i>p</i> &lt; .001),
                    respectively. A 1% increase in percentage of students who received FRL was associated with an
                    increased probability of change of placement, with an odds ratio of 1.020 (<i>p</i> &lt; .001).
                    Holding every other variable constant, town schools were less likely to change student&rsquo;s
                    placement, with an odds ratio of 0.562 (<i>p</i> = .032). Both middle/junior high and senior high
                    schools were more likely to change a student&rsquo;s placement, with the odds ratios of 15.857
                    (<i>p</i> &lt; .001) and 9.604 (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), respectively.</p>
                <p>Among schools within the same LEA that changed students&rsquo; placements, a 1% increase in
                    percentage of students classified as special education, who received FRL, or were Black or African
                    American was associated with an increase in number of changes of placement per student, with event
                    ratio rates of 1.020 (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), 1.017 (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), and 1.005 (<i>p</i> = .006),
                    respectively. Among schools within the same LEA that changed students&rsquo; placements, town
                    schools enforced more changes of placement, with the event ratio rate of 1.387 (<i>p</i> = .045).
                    Similarly, among schools within the same LEA that changed students&rsquo; placements, elementary
                    schools changed placement less often, with an event ratio rate of 0.506 (<i>p</i> = .002).</p>

            <h3>Research Question 3</h3>
            <p>Among schools located in the same LEA that allow corporal punishment, the probability of using corporal
                punishment versus not using the practice was not statistically different than zero, with a threshold
                value of 1.109 (<i>p</i> = .349; see <a href="#">Table 5</a>). Within the same LEA, a 1% increase in
                students classified as special education or who were Black or African American was associated with a
                decreased probability of corporal punishment, with odds ratios of 0.925 (<i>p</i> = .046) and 0.962 (<i>p</i>
                &lt; .001), respectively. Also, among the schools located in LEAs that allow corporal punishment,
                compared with combined schools, elementary schools and senior high schools enforced less corporal
                punishment, with event ratio rates of 0.535 (<i>p</i> = .020) and 0.454 (<i>p</i> = .043), respectively.

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>Collection, analysis, and reporting of disciplinary data are critical for addressing the disproportionate use
            of school disciplinary practices (<a href="#">Gershoff &amp; Bitensky, 2007</a>; <a href="#">Krezmien et
                al., 2006</a>; <a href="#">Townsend, 2000</a>). The current study provides a comprehensive statewide
            analysis of punitive discipline practices in Florida. Concerning the characteristics of students in the
            current sample, data align with national reports revealing that the Florida student population differs from
            national averages in three important ways. First, the mean percent of students in special education was
            about 20% in Florida compared with a national average of approximately 9% (<a href="#">USDOE, 2012</a>).
            Second, the mean percent of students receiving FRL was near 60%, compared with 48% nationally (<a href="#">NCES,
                2013</a>). Third, about 23% of students are Black or African American, compared with 17% of students
            across the United States (<a href="#">NCES, 2011</a>). Student characteristics are important to consider
            when discussing trends in punitive discipline practices, given the historically disproportionate use with
            these students observed in smaller scale Florida studies (<a href="#">Balfanz et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#">Mendez
                &amp; Knoff, 2003</a>; <a href="#">Mendez et al., 2002</a>).</p>
        <p>Overwhelmingly, suspension was the most commonly used punitive practice. At 548,790 incidences, the total
            weighted number of suspensions was almost 50 times more than the next most common practice (i.e., 11,048
            restraints). The high number of suspensions is disconcerting, given that its use has been associated with
            lower achievement, increased likelihood of dropping out of school, antisocial behavior, and involvement with
            the juvenile justice system (<a href="#">Arcia, 2006</a>; <a href="#">Christle et al., 2004</a>; <a
                    href="#">Hemphill, Toumbourou, Herrenkohl, McMorris, &amp; Catalano, 2006</a>; <a href="#">USDOE,
                2014b</a>). The current study does not address the reasons for, or possible necessity of, suspension in
            Florida schools. However, the frequent use of suspension could be an indication that suspension is used in
            lieu of more proactive and positive approaches to student behavior, particularly because Florida continues
            to suspend the highest percentage of students in the country (<a href="#">Losen et al., 2015</a>).</p>
        <section>
            <h3>Punitive Discipline Practices and Grade Level, Gender, and Race</h3>
            <p>With regard to Research Question 1 and the associations between the frequency and type of punitive
                discipline practice used and student characteristics, results are mostly consistent with previous
                research. Other results paint a more nuanced picture, however, of Florida punitive discipline practices.
                For example, a significant association existed between type of punitive discipline practice and student
                gender, race, and grade level. As in previous research, males and Black or African American students
                received punitive discipline more often (<a href="#">Losen &amp; Martinez, 2013</a>; <a href="#">Skiba
                    et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#">USDOE, 2014a</a>). However, Black or African American students
                received corporal punishment less frequently. Also consistent with previous research, overall use of
                punitive discipline practices was most frequent in Grades 6 to 8 (<a href="#">Arcia, 2006</a>, <a
                        href="#">2007</a>; <a href="#">Mendez et al., 2002</a>). Yet, certain punitive practices, such
                as corporal punishment and restraint, were used more frequently in the early grades, whereas high school
                students were more frequently expelled.</p>
            <p>Several implications are evident from the use of punitive discipline practices with particular subgroups
                of students. First, as in other studies, the disproportionate punishment of Black or African American,
                male, and middle school students is clear. The disproportionate use of punitive discipline practices is
                disturbing, especially given that the percentage of Black or African American youth in Florida is much
                higher than the national average (<a href="#">NCES, 2011</a>). Moreover, a recent study (<a href="#">Morris
                    &amp; Perry, 2016</a>) noted that the overrepresentation of Black or African American students who
                are suspended is linked to racial inequalities in academic achievement. Reasons for the reduced use of
                corporal punishment with Black or African American students are unclear. Research is needed to better
                understand the relationship between these practices and school policies and procedures, as well as
                administrator and teacher perceptions and practices (<a href="#">Sullivan et al., 2014</a>).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Punitive Discipline Practices and School and LEA Characteristics</h3>
            <p>A complex picture is evident with regard to punitive discipline practices and characteristics of schools
                and LEAs. Patterns in the data existed with school and LEA characteristics and the use of restraint,
                expulsion, and change of placement. Conclusions would be highly tenuous, however, given the limited
                frequency of each of these practices. A few salient points are nonetheless noteworthy, especially with
                regard to suspension. Schools in LEAs allowing corporal punishment enforced more suspensions, compared
                with schools located in LEAs that do not allow the use of this practice. No previous research has
                identified or considered the reasons for this association. It could be hypothesized that LEAs that allow
                corporal punishment are overall more inclined to rely on reactive and negative approaches to student
                misbehavior, rather than approaches that promote student understanding of needed behavioral change (<a
                        href="#">Human Rights Watch, 2008</a>). However, substantiation of such an assertion requires
                additional research.</p>
            <p>Two additional findings related to suspension are noteworthy. First, within the same LEA and as compared
                with combined schools, elementary school students received significantly less suspensions, whereas
                middle junior high and high school students received significantly more. To more fully understand these
                differences, research is needed to better understand the reasons for the suspensions, the existing
                alternatives available to principals, and the extent to which schools within a given LEA implement
                proactive approaches to youth behavior (<a href="#">Losen &amp; Gillespie, 2012</a>). The second finding
                worthy of note in terms of school characteristics and suspension is that the proportion of students who
                receive FRL and who are Black or African American is associated with per student increases in
                suspension. The reasons that schools with particular student populations use more suspensions are
                undoubtedly complex. Schools that serve poor and minority students are faced with a host of challenges,
                including (a) unqualified general and special education teachers, as well as teacher shortages and
                attrition (<a href="#">Goldhaber, Lavery, &amp; Theobald, 2014</a>; <a href="#">Mason-Williams, 2015</a>;
                <a href="#">McLeskey, Tyler, &amp; Flippin, 2004</a>); (b) a lack of resources that result in less
                rigorous curricula (<a href="#">Farkas &amp; Duffett, 2008</a>); and (c) higher incidence of student
                problem behavior and classroom aggression (<a href="#">Thomas, Bierman, &amp; The Conduct Problems
                    Prevention Research Group, 2006</a>). Future research should explore these issues in terms of their
                relationship to the use of suspension.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Corporal Punishment and School and LEA Characteristics</h3>
            <p>It is encouraging that the use of corporal punishment, although legal in Florida, is a relatively rarely
                used punitive discipline practice. The low occurrence of corporal punishment inhibits further
                evaluation, in terms of school and LEA characteristics. However, it is unequivocal that the use of
                corporal punishment in schools, however rare, is a harmful practice that should be immediately
                discontinued (<a href="#">Gagnon, Kennedy-Lewis, &amp; Gurel, 2014</a>).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>Limitations to the current study are related to the completeness of the data set used, as well as to our
                analytical approach. First, it is important to note that the data used were from the 2010&ndash;2011
                school year. Since that time, the Florida PBS Project has continued their statewide initiative to
                provide training and technical assistance in an effort to promote a more proactive and positive approach
                to student behavior. However, the most recent suspension data indicate a continuing problem, with
                Florida suspending the highest percentage of students of any U.S. state (<a href="#">Losen et al.,
                    2015</a>; <a href="#">Snyder &amp; Dillow, 2015</a>). Concerning the nature of the data set,
                students receiving the same punitive discipline practice multiple times were counted only once at the
                school level. A student could be counted more than once, however, if he or she received two or more
                different punitive discipline consequences. This data recording system may decrease the total frequency
                of punitive discipline practices that are actually reported. If members of any particular group of
                students receive any particular punitive discipline practices frequently, this issue becomes more
                serious. To address this issue, schools, LEAs, and states should collect and make publicly available
                de-identified data on the actual number of occurrences of punitive discipline practices by student. In
                addition, both Florida DOE data as well as CCD data are based on school and LEA personnel self-reports.
                Future research should address the potential errors in reporting, through common databases of student
                disciplinary data across schools and LEAs.</p>
            <p>A few limitations concerning our approach to data analyses are worthy of note. The two-part analysis
                procedure that we have employed regarding punitive discipline outcomes was initially built for zero
                inflated, semicontinuous outcomes. However, the actual outcome in these analyses was the number of
                punitive discipline practices linked to the predictors when using a log transformation. Consequently,
                outcomes in the second stage of analyses were count rather than continuous in nature. Using log
                transformations for the outcomes may create concerns with statistical conclusion validity regarding both
                standard errors and parameter estimates. To address this issue, we used maximum likelihood estimation
                with robust standard error using a numerical integration algorithm (MLR). MLR is recommended when an
                outcome is censored, unordered, or categorical because the MLR estimator provides standard errors that
                are robust to nonnormality, which is the case for the censored log-transformed outcome variables (<a
                        href="#">Muth&eacute;n &amp; Muth&eacute;n, 2012</a>).</p>
            <p>Another issue was the high number of schools in the sample. Using a continuous model, rather than a
                Poisson model, is preferred because it does not change the validity of the population parameter
                estimates, and the assumption of restrictive population variance required for a Poisson model is
                avoided. Similar to common Poisson model interpretations, we created exponential transformations for
                population parameter estimates and interpreted them similar to event rate ratios. Although Poisson
                distribution involves an error term at the school level, the procedure estimates another error term at
                the student or practice level (Level 1) because the outcome is assumed to be continuous. Due to this
                Level 1 error term difference, the exponential transformed population parameter estimates may not be the
                precise event ratio rates. Therefore, the interpretation may not be precise. Considering, however, that
                we used only a direct transformation, the direction and the size of the relation between predictors and
                outcomes should hold regardless of the error term defined in the model and ensure that the
                interpretations are within reasonable limits. Finally, we assumed that LEAs are sampled from an
                infinitely large number of LEAs, and schools are sampled from an infinitely large number of schools
                within LEAs for all the models. This assumption increases the standard errors, but allows for the
                generalizability of the results to all LEAs within the Florida school population.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Recommendations</h3>
            <p>Important recommendations for policy and practice can be garnered from the current study. Consistent with
                the recommendations of <a href="#">Sullivan et al. (2013)</a>, there is a need for the state to collect
                and analyze punitive discipline data, with a concerted emphasis on inclusion of data across student,
                school, and LEA variables. Given the frequent and disproportionate use of suspension and other punitive
                discipline practices with particular student groups, information should be disaggregated and publicly
                reported by race, gender, FRL, and disability. Moreover, schools and LEAs must be held accountable for
                their decision to use punitive discipline practices, particularly when it is evident that these
                practices are disproportionally used with certain youth and in high poverty and/or high minority
                schools.</p>
            <p>The current study did not address the reasons for the disproportionate use of punitive discipline
                practices, or identify the current positive and proactive approaches implemented in schools. Although
                researchers need to evaluate current proactive approaches to student behavior in Florida schools,
                statewide efforts to reduce reliance on punitive discipline practices through effective prevention and
                intervention can occur immediately. Statewide efforts, such as comprehensive professional development,
                are needed to ensure implementation of multitiered levels of behavioral support and to emphasize social
                emotional learning programs, cognitive-behavioral interventions, and restorative justice approaches (<a

                <a href="#">Losen &amp; Martinez, 2013</a>). The state, as well as individual LEAs and schools, should
                also move forward with a comprehensive evaluation of the infractions that result in suspension. In the
                age of zero tolerance, there has been an increase in the use of suspension for relatively minor
                incidences (<a href="#">Kang-Brown, Trone, Fratello, &amp; Daftary-Kapur, 2013</a>), and it is critical
                to understand the nature of misbehavior that is leading to the use of this and other punitive
                disciplinary practices.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the use of punitive discipline practices in Florida schools.
            The results paint a troubling picture wherein certain youth are disproportionally affected by negative and
            exclusionary approaches to student misbehavior. Although additional research is certainly needed, state-,
            LEA-, and school-wide initiatives are imperative to promote fair and appropriate responses to student
            behavior, and provide students with educational opportunities to which they are entitled.</p>
