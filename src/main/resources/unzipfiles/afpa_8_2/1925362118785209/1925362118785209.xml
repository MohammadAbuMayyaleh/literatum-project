      was founded in 2011 with Dr. Keith Pinckard as
      it first Editor-In-Chief. Since its inception, it has been the Official Journal of the
      National Association of Medical Examiners. Throughout the last eight years, Dr. Pinckard has
      guided the Journal through from its birth to maturity. In this period, four issues have been
      published each year with hundreds of articles written, both reviews and new papers, with many
      papers written by people new to publishing. The Journal has proven a great success and it is a
      singular honor to take over from Keith as the Interim Editor-In-Chief. Keith moves on to
      become Editor Emeritus. The Associate Editor and editorial board remain the same. This will be
      the second issue published under the association with Sage Journals. The concept of the
      Journal remains the same, and themed issues will continue to be published. With Sage Journals,
      the reach of the Journal is expanding.

      In this issue, the liver and pancreatico-duodenal system is the focus of the papers
      published. This is an anatomical area that involves many diseases, toxins, and trauma that the
      forensic pathologist has to interpret and, as usual with papers in
      <italic>Academic Forensic
        Pathology</italic>
      , there is much practical information. As ever, not all papers are invited
      reviews and once more I invite all authors to consider submitting their work for publication
      in the Journal, whether reviews, images in forensic pathology, or new research. Forensic
      pathology remains a vibrant specialty with an academic base. This Journal has a central role
      as the academic journal of death investigation and it is my intention to build on the work of
      Dr. Pinckard and keep this journal as the Journal for and by forensic pathologists.
